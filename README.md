#  React App : Bot Battlr

## Code Challenge: Bot Battlr
Welcome to Bot Battlr, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army! 

Our dispalys a list of available bots, and alows a user to add any bot to his army of bots. 

## Json Server Script

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm run server`

Launches the JSON server in the interactive watch mode.\


## Getting Started : Project Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local environment
2. On Your terminal, navigate to the cloned repository, type "npm install" to install all dependencies.
3. Type "npm run server" to launch json server. port will open on "http://localhost:8001". resources can be accessed at "http://localhost:8001/bots/"
4. Finally run npm start to launch the project on your browser

##

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
